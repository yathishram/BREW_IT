                <p>Well it is not just a simple Web lab project for us. It is something close to our hearts. Coffee is something we have found to be intriguing and unknown to us and eventually ending up as love. We tried our level best to tell a story of coffee with this project. This website aims to get people thinking about what exactly is going on in India with coffee. Any person visiting this website can goof around to learn about different brewing methods, different places to buy the best coffee. It was designed to be minimal and concentrate more on the Usability. Well there is a lot of work to be done in order to improve some functionalities which shall be added in the future. Until then Keep Calm Drink Coffee.

                <p>Who are we? Well being in engineering has taught us one important thing, explore what you love and we did it. We explored coffee. Coffee has been with us from past 4 years helping us through tough times and happy times. We have tried every type of coffee out there. Well if you believe even our laptop stickers are related to coffee, our Insta Bios are based on coffee. And the one of the best places we hang out is Alchemy. Beware when you call us to your home, we judge you by the type of coffee you drink. If its instant coffee well we are out there in an instant, if it is anything we are up for a chat. Well follow us on insta for many fun content @yathish_ram and @tejnaren</p>
