            Wait where can we buy the best blends?
            </h1>
           <p>With the increase in the craze for coffee and India producing some of the finest coffee beans, some companies have brought in a different spin to the traditional coffee business. With a wide range of different products some brands have built a huge fan base. Here we are going to list some of the companies that we think have made an impact on us.</p>
           <div class="Bluetokai">
                <h2>Blue Tokai</h2>
                <p>Blue tokai has been growing to be let’s say the best brand according to me for the effort they put in for making sure everyone gets the best cup of coffee. Even though they don’t own estates like many coffee brewing or roasteries do, they go to extents to make sure that the customers are introduced to the best coffees that they buy directly from estates. Their mission to make sure this happens led them to open up cafes and selling some of the best blends one would want to taste. With the ability for the customer to choose the right blend for each kind of brewing technique, I guess this one is always the best for me.

            </div>
            <div class="indianbean">
                    <h2>The Indian Bean</h2>
                <p>They might be the only company that runs on the idea of Single -Estate Coffee. They buy beans from single farm and no mixing and blending coffee from different estates but rather retain the taste of the beans from estate it has sourced. They make use of free trade or fair trade to make sure when a customer buys coffee over their website they buy the beans directly from estates roast and send you the right love. Here the exporter is eliminated like how Race 3 movie didn’t make sense. There blends are something one can check out for that native taste.

            <div class="halliberri">
                    <h2>Halli Berri</h2>
                <p>Lets just say Halli Berri is not just some coffee estate or roastery. It is one of the most beautiful estates that lets you indulge into nature. A family estate that has been living in the estate over 6 generations. So one can expect the kind of love, hospitality and care one needs with every cup of coffee. With the flavour of honey dew the coffee from their own estate is something one would want to try out. And for those who want to get away from their hectic, monotonous and busy life Halli Berri would be the perfect getaway to the world of “Vast countrysides rivers, valleys, epic landscapes and plenty of furry animals” as quoted by them. Their coffee is available on Amazon.

            <div class="coffeeco">
                    <h2>The Coffee Co</h2>
                <p> The Coffee co sounds like the serious people into serious coffee business. Well it has nothing much to offer than few flavours of coffee that is seriously the few of the premium ones that elevate your senses and make you feel like an Ambani. They might be one of the few companies which offer premium coffee blends.

            <div class="flyingsqurriel">
                    <h2>The Flying Squrriel</h2>
                
                <p>The Flying Squirrel markets itself as India’s Only Artisan Coffee. Sounds fancy but it is simple. They know their beans so well that they are handcrafted, micro-lot and is later taken through different unique process that makes sure it tastes and smells the same. Naming it fancy isn’t enough for these folks, with the variety of coffees they have makes us wonder are we gonna taste all these? One of the most peculiar blend of theirs is Clouds In My Coffee which is interesting. Beans are sent to the coastal region to enhance its flavours by bathing in the moist sea air. Well if you want you could try one for sure.

            <div class="Blackbaza">
                    <h2>Black Baza Coffee Co</h2>
                <p>Well let’s say one of the most interesting coffee company I have come across. They are an activist company trying to stabilize the livelihoods the coffee farmers and helping them in many ways. What caught my eye was the interesting names they use for their blends Wanderoo, Jumping Ants, Black Baza and others. While they are a small group of activists and company it is pretty interesting to see how they impact the lives of coffee farmers.

            </div>
            <div>
                    <p> Well there are other old coffee roasters out there doing the best to make sure every Indian household has coffee. Be it our very own Cafe Coffee Day which changed the whole idea of Coffee and the way one could enjoy. Cafe Coffee Day according to me is the best way they could get coffee to everyone. The above companies that I have mentioned are the ones trying to change the idea behind coffee, creating a movement in terms of sustainability and creating moments for customer when they drink that coffee. It is easy to drink a cup of coffee every morning, but it is important for us to appreciate their efforts.</p>
