                <h2>Aeropress</h2>
                <p>People new to it always ask: “What’s so special about the AeroPress?” There are a few things that contribute to its fame and popularity. First of all, AeroPress is an inexpensive device., is probably one of the least expensive brewers on the market. But the price is not the concern of us coffee lovers. We spend an expensive equipment to get a great cup, so the cost is not the most important aspect.
                    Many people love it because of its cleaner cup and milder taste, at the same time having a rich and complex taste. AeroPress is a milder version of espresso if brewed correctly. Some drip coffee lovers enjoy the stronger coffee made with the AeroPress, but the bolder flavor of espresso is too much for them.

                    <h2>Turskish Coffee</h2>
                <img src="/assets/cezve.svg" float="right"></img>
                <p>Turkish coffee is a method of infusing finely ground coffee in nearly boiling water. What is very specific to Turkish brewing method is the grind size which is the finest possible, almost a powder. There are no electrical Turkish coffee grinding machines for the residential use, but the manual mills work perfectly. Turkish coffee has the fullest body of all brewing methods</p>

            <div class="drip">
                    <h2>Drip Coffee</h2>
                <img src="/assets/drip.svg" float="left"></img>
                <p>Drip coffee or filter coffee is one of the most popular coffee brewing methods. The method involves pouring hot water over ground coffee beans. We strain the brew with a paper filter, or a metal or plastic mesh. The coffee from a drip brewer is clear and clean, with a high ratio of caffeine extracted per spoon of ground coffee. The brew is good if you use a good coffee machine, but it’s only average with cheap equipment. Pour-over devices can compete with high-end coffee makers such as Technivorm or Bonavita, in terms of taste and aroma. However, manual drippers, as they are also called, are less convenient than electrical drip brewers.</p>

                    <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
                <img src="/assets/brew.svg" float="right"></img>
                <p> If regular, hot, coffee brews upset your stomach, cold brew is your choice. The brewing method implies steeping coffee grinds for extended periods of time, (12 to 36 hours), then straining it and serving it cold or hot. Because it takes so long to brew, people prepare large batches and store it in the fridge for several days.</p>

                    <h2>Mocha</h2>
                <img src="/assets/coffee-pot.svg" float="left"></img>
                <p>Moka pot is a device for making coffee that uses steam pressure to push water through coffee grinds similar to espresso method, but with much lower pressure. The pressure in a Moka pot is about 1 bar compared to a real espresso machine with 9 bar. The coffee made in a Moka pot, as you would expect, is very bold, it resembles espresso. Stovetop espresso lacks the crema, and it has much less aromatic oils. It is a decent espresso alternative</p>

            <div class="french">
                    <h2>French Press</h2>
                <img src="/assets/french-press.svg"float="right"></img>
                <p>French press, or press pot, is a very simple coffee brewing device with a beaker and a plunger/filter. The preparation technique consists of pouring hot water over coffee grinds and let it steep for a few minutes. After the steeping is over the plunger/ filter is pressed down, to separate the grinds. French press coffee has a medium body, less than espresso but denser than drip. The aroma and flavor of a press pot coffee are intense, and the method it is gaining more and more popularity.</p>

                <img src="/assets/espresso.svg" float="left"></img>
                <p>Espresso is prepared by pushing hot water through a layer of compacted ground coffee, contained in a port-filter. Espresso is a very concentrated coffee, with a lot of body, aroma, and flavor. It contains a lot of coffee oils and solids. The most distinctive features of espresso are the foamy layer on top and the low volume of the drink.</p>
